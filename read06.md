## Javascript

- JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles for user interaction.
- ***JAVA AND JAVA SCRIPT ARE NOT THE SAME LANGUAGE!!!!***

## Variables

- Variables are containers for storing data 
- 4 ways to declare a JavaScript variable: 
var
let
const
nothing

- General rule: always declare variables with const.

- If you think the value of the variable can change, use let.
- All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called *identifiers*.

## Identifiers can be short names or more descriptive ones. 

- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
- Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names. 

## Assignment Operator

- In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. ex. x = x + 5. It assigns the value of x + 5 to x.
- The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript.

## Javascript data types

- JavaScript variables can hold numbers and text values.
- Text values are called text strings.
- Text strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

## Declaring a javascript variable

- Creating a variable in JavaScript is called *declaring* a variable.
