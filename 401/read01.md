## The command line

- This one was not super helpful due to the fact I am using iterm. It was a tad different but stll apllied to the basics for me.

## Basic Navigation

- This is the stuff we have been learning and utilizing through the course so far. The terminal is very fun to play around with but can get frustrating quickly if you mess up or forget a syntax.

## More about files

- For this one in particular, i was questioning things.  it looks different from the one i have on my laptop and talks about linux. is there a difference or do the same rules apply to mine?

## Manual Pages
I had never seen Manual pages before so that was very interesting to see. They are also very helpful but its going to be something id have to rremember about in a pinch so i am curious to see whaen i am going to need them!

## File Manipulation

- This again was a bunch of stuff we learned through this school. it was cool getting a refresher on it though since we have been out of school for a month. we practiced coding but i didnt touch my terminal much! 

## Cheatsheet

I'm 1000% saving this to my bookmarks. If i run into an issue i will have this tool and im happy about it.
