## Control flow

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line. 

## Javascript functions

- A javascript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
- A javascript function is executed when something invokes or calls it. 
- When javascript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
- You can reuse your code. Define it one time and use it as many times as needed with different arguments to produce different results. 
- ***The () Operator Invokes the Function***
- Functions can be used the same way as you use variables. In any type of formula, assignment, or calculation.
- Variables declared within a javascript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
- ex. // code here can NOT use carName

function myFunction() {
  let carName = "Volvo";
  // code here CAN use carName
}

// code here can NOT use carName
