# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Chapter 3: Lists

- 3 types of lists: 
  - Unordered(<ul>): each item begins with a bullet point.
  
  - Ordered(<ol>): each item is number in numerical order.
  
  - Definition(<dl>): set of terms with definitions of the terms.

## Chapter 13: Boxes

- By default a box is sized perfectly to hold whatever is inside of it. To adjust the dimensions for a box you can use the height and width properties yourself. Can be definedc by pixels, percentages or ems. 

- You can also limit height and width with min/max-width and min/max-height. 

- Every box has 3 properties that can be changed. 
  - Border: The border separates the edge of one box from another.
  
  - Margin: Sits outside the edge of the border.
  
  - Padding: Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

  ## Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

  - Arrays: Variable that stores a list of values, not just one. They are read as a numbered list. 

  ## Chapter 4: Decisions and Loops

  - Switch statement: Indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. There is a general option that is run if none of the statements match. 

  - Truthy and Falsy: 
    - truthy: values treated as true or numbers other than 0.

    - falsy: values treated as false or 0

  - Loops: loops verify a condition. if it reads true the codeblock runs. As long as the statement is true it will continue to run.

    - for: used if you need a code ran a specific number of times.

    - while: used if you don't know how many times a code needs to be ran

    - do while: similar to a while loop, but will always run statements in the curly brackets once at least.
