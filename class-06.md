# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

## First Reading: Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming

- Why problem domains are difficult: writing code is like doing a jigsaw puzzle. Putting together code to build components from a bigger problem domain, which is like a puzzle with a blury picture or no picture at all. 

- Two things you can do to make problem domains easier: 
  
  - make the problem domain easier. 

  - get a better understanding of problem domains. 

  - Take parts of the domain and get an understanding piece by piece. 

## Whatâ€™s the Difference Between Primitive Values and Object References in JavaScript?

- JavaScript data types can be but in two categories. 

  - Primitive values and object references. 

- Full list of JS data types. 

  - Boolean
  
  - Null

  - Undefined

  - Number

  - BigInt

  - String

  - Symbol

  - Objects

- Arrays, functions, and dates are objects. 

- Difference between a value and reference: primitive values are assinged a variable directly to that value. 

- When a variable is assigned with an object, instead of containing the value directly, the variable becomes a reference to it. 

- Mutable and immutable data: primitive values can't be changed and object references can. 

## Chapter 3: Object Literals

- Variables become known as properties and functions are known as methods in an object. 

## Chapter 5: Document Object Model (DOM)

- DOM: Defines how a browser should create an HTML file and how JAvaScript will affect a webpage while in the browser. 

- Dom tree: The model of a webpage

- To access the dom tree, you must locate the node you want to work on and use its content, child elements, and attributes. 

- getElementById: allows selecting a specific element. 

- item() : returns an inividual from the Nodelist. 

- getElementsByClassName: selects elements with a class value. 

- query selector() : selects the first css element node. 

- createElement: adds a new element to the dom tree.
