# My 201 Learning Journal

## Growth Mindset :facepunch:
A growth mindset to me is a very differtent way of thinking. It requires discipline, a down sizing of your ego and a ***lot*** of self motivation. 
Its easy to give up. Its easy to be mad at others success. What's difficult is changing your minset to celebrate others successes and work to get to where they are and beyond. Bill Gates once said, "Itâ€™s fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure". 
Here is a good little read I liked a lot for an analyzation on the [quote](https://julien-foussard.com/en/2020/01/28/julien-foussard-quote-bill-gates/).

### 3 Reminders to stay on track :muscle:
- Accept challenges. Anything you really put your mind to, you can achieve.
- When you run into an obstacle you can't figure out, take a break and come back to it a little later. A little time off is good for the brain.
- Accept critisism and use it to get better. My father used to tell me all the time, "There will always be somebody bigger, stronger, smarter than you. Pay attention to the things they do, and do even better."
