## What is CSS?

- CSS means Cascading Style Sheets. 
- It allows complete customization of valid coding through HTML. 
- It is a rule based language. You define the rules to specify groups of styles. 
- All web standards technologies or languages (ex. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) are defined in documents called specifications, which are published by standards organizations (such as the W3C, WHATWG, ECMA, or Khronos) and define precisely how those technologies are supposed to behave. New CSS features are developed, or specified, by the CSS Working Group

## Three ways to insert CSS

- Externally, Internally, Inline. 
- External: You can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file.
- Internal: May be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. (<style>)allows customizatoin. 
- Inline: Used to apply a unique style for a single element. Add the style attribute to the relevant element. Can contain any CSS property.
- If some properties have been defined for the same element in different style sheets, the value from the last read style sheet will be used. 

## Color in CSS

- Color: Specifies the color of the text. 
- Initial: sets the property to its default value. 
- Inherit: Inherits property from its parent element. 
- Can use Hex values and RGB(A) and HSL(A).
