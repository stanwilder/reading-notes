## GIT.

- Default text editor: Without configuration of a default text editor, Git will use the system’s default editor. It will most likely be Vim.
- Getting help: There are three ways to get more information on a particular command, by accessing the manual: git help command, git command --help, man git-command.

## Setting up a git repo. 
***Importing***
- Switch to the target project’s directory, use the git init command, git add *.c, git ass LICENSE, git commit -m "anything"

***Cloning***
- command: git clone "web adress copied from. github" 

***Saving changes***
- All files in a working copy of a project file are either in a tracked or untracked state.
- Tracked: Can be modified, unmodified, or staged. It was part of the most recent file snapshot.
- Untracked: Were not in the last snapshot and do not currently reside in the staging area.
- Check file status: the correct command is "git status".
- git remote: command that allows viewing of all remote handles. 
***A.C.P.***
