# Notes on Wireframing

## Wire Framing
- Wireframe: a practice used by devs which allows defining and planning the design of their website, app, or product. 
- Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
- Drawing your design out on paper or a whiteboard has its advantages. It allows changes to be made easier, its cheaper, and allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

## 6 steps to make a wire frame
- Do your research: Analyzation of similar product lines to your own, digging into prevailing UX trends and best practises, and reviewing your own internal design guidelines.
- Prepare your research for quick reference: Make cheatsheets!!
- Make sure you have your user flow mapped out: Make sure yiur users can be self sufficent. 
- Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate: You’re outlining features and formats, not illustrating in fine detail.
- Add some detail and get testing: Add detail in the way you would naturally process a screen, or the page of a book: top-to-bottom and left-to-right.
- Start turning your wireframes into prototypes: Use the sites liated about to creat prtototypes.

## Clarity, confidence and Simplicity are KEY!!

## HTML basics
- HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
- The main parts of an element.

- The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect.
- The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends.
- The content: This is the content of the element, or just text.
- The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
- You can put elements inside other elements too. it's called nesting.
- Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. ex. <img>
- Unordered lists are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter. These are wrapped in a <ul> element.
- Ordered lists are for lists where the order of the items does matter. These are wrapped in an <ol> element.
- Semantics in HTML: A semantic element gives the text it wraps around the role or meaning.
  Examples: <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <mark>.
