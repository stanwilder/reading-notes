# What Google Learned About Teams

- project Aristotle’s researchers began by reviewing a half-century of academic studies looking at how teams worked.

- Some groups that were ranked among Google’s most effective teams, for instance, were composed of friends who socialized outside work.

- First, on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.

- Second, the good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’ — a fancy way of saying they were skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice.
